# TravelTide
Customer Segmentation for rewards program, TravelTide
## Project Description
E-booking startup TravelTide is a new player in the online travel industry. It has experienced steady growth since it was founded at the end of the COVID-19 pandemic (2021-04).
##  Used Tools
PostgreSQL, Tableau
## The Goal
This project analyzes user assignments to the perks (rewards program) to identify key trends and insights.<br>
**The Perks are:** <br>
- **free hotel meal**
- **free checked bags**
- **no cancellation fees**
- **exclusive discounts**
- **1 night free stay for the flights**<br>
Used Method: Manual customer segmentation (based on age and demographic characteristics such as children and marital status) was conducted to identify typical behavior patterns and derive insights for a personalized rewards program.
## Key Points and Insights
TravelTide currently has around 1 million customers.
The company has recorded over 5 million app sessions with its customers.
As suggested by Elena, we only included customers with more than 7 sessions since January 4th, 2023 in the analysis.
There are inconsistencies in the data regarding the number of nights (e.g. negative values), so these entries were excluded from the analysis.
- The target group "Under 25" has the highest cancellation ratio, so offering "no cancellation fees" to this group makes sense — but only up to a certain timeframe, e.g. free cancellation up to 5 days before the trip.
- The "Under 25" group books the most flights and hotels with discounts, but they tend to be more attracted by smaller discounts. Therefore, offering a perk like "1 free hotel meal" is a good fit for this group.
- The "25–35" age group is second in terms of the number of discounted flights and hotel bookings. They are more drawn to higher discounts, so the recommended perk for them is "1 night free hotel with flight".
- The "25–35 Married" cluster books the highest average number of seats and checked bags per person, which makes the perk "free checked bag" especially appealing to them.
- The largest number of customers falls within the "35–50 Female" and "50+ Female" groups. These groups also have the highest number of trips and sessions booked. We can target the clusters "35–50 Female, married, with children" and "50+ Female, married, with children" with additional perks like "free seat selection" and "priority boarding".
- The target group "35–50 Female, unmarried and without children" is willing to pay the highest hotel room rates and flight prices. Offering "exclusive discounts" makes sense for this cluster. They book frequently, so discounts add value and can increase loyalty. Discounts on spa or lounge services may also be appealing, as this group is without family and tends to focus more on themselves — therefore, comfort-oriented perks are a great fit.
- Long distance travelers are generally price- and comfort-sensitive. Recommended perks for this group include free checked bag and lounge access. For short-distance city routes such as Chicago, Dallas, and Detroit, we can offer no cancellation fees, since short trips tend to change more spontaneously.
- For target groups that book fewer trips, such as "35–35 Men, unmarried" and "50+ Men, unmarried", we can proactively offer "exclusive discounts" to help prevent churn.
- Most customer segments stay on average 3 to 4 nights, but two groups clearly stand out with 6-night stays: "Under 25, married" and "Under 25, unmarried". These young users tend to book longer stays than any other group. We can offer perks such as local experience vouchers for multi-day stays and “stay-longer” discounts, e.g. 10% off for stays of 5 nights or more.
